# Database_Design_And_Development
A Project To Design And Construct A Database That Can Be Deployed In A Commercial Database Management system

It is asked to build a database for a dental practice based on the given narrative. 
The entities and their relations are identified. ERD diagrams at conceptual, logical, and physical levels are constructed. 
The physical level of the ERD is intended for MYSQL. Tables, Attributes, and Keys of the database are developed and Constraints are explained. 
The PDF file (RelationalSchema.pdf) containing these data can be found in the same directory of this file.
Three SQL scripts for CREATE, INSERT, and Other Queries are formed and can be found as dentalsurgery.sql, Queries_dentalSuregry.sql respectively.
The file CoddsRule.pdf contains the explanations of Coddsâ€™ rules and SQL demonstration (for first 10 rules) based on the created database.
